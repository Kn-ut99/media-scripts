=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mtsremux> B<input.mts> [B<extrainput.mts...>] B<output.ts>


=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item B<input.mts>

Input file in I<.mts> format, as generated by recent AVCHD video cameras.

=item B<output.ts>

Output file, which will be a standard MPEG-TS (Transport Stream).

=item B<extrainput.mts>

If more than one input file is given, all I<.mts> inputs will be appended in
the given order, to assemble a stream which contains all of them in that
order.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<mtsremux> will remux a number of I<.mts> files, which are typically
created by modern AVCHD video camcorders, into a single, big and standard
MPEG-TS (Transport Stream). The generated file is more likely to be
recognized by other video tools and editors for further processing.

If more than one I<.mts> file is given as input, they I<must> have the same
stream order, frame sizes and codec settings (both for video and audio).
Concatenation probably will fail horribly if those contraints are not met.
Usually videos from the same video camera will have the same parameters, and
can be appended safely.

It is recommended to name the output file ending with the I<.ts> suffix.
Output will be always MPEG-TS, regardless of the output file name.

No video or audio processing is done at all, only remuxing takes place.


=head1 RETURN VALUE

B<mtsremux> returns exit status 0 on success.
