Multimedia-related scripts -- use at your own risk :-)

To install them, just type:

    make install

By default, scripts are installed in the current user's home directory,
with prefix at ~/.local (so make sure you have ~/.local/bin in your $PATH).
You can change the behaviour when invoking the make:

    make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/foo/

Note that DESTDIR is optional, and only needed if you want to further
package things e.g. in a .deb or .rpm package.
